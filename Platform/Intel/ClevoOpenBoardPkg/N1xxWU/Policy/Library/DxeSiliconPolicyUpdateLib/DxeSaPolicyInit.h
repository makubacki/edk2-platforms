/**
  <b>SA DXE Policy Driver Entry Point</b> \n
  - <b>Introduction</b> \n
    System Agent DXE drivers behavior can be controlled by platform policy without modifying reference code directly.
    Platform policy Protocol is initialized with default settings in this funciton.
    This policy Protocol has to be initialized prior to System Agent initialization DXE drivers execution.

  - @pre
    - Runtime variable service should be ready if policy initialization required.

  - @result
    SA_POLICY_PROTOCOL will be installed successfully and ready for System Agent reference code use.

  - <b>Porting Recommendations</b> \n
    Policy should be initialized basing on platform design or user selection (like BIOS Setup Menu)

  @param[in] ImageHandle - Image handle of this driver.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           Initialization complete.
  @exception EFI_UNSUPPORTED    The chipset is unsupported by this driver.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  Do not have enough resources to initialize the driver.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      Device error, driver exits abnormally.
