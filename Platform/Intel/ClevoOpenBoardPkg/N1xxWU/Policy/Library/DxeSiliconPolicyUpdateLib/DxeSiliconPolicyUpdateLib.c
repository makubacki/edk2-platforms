/**
  Performs silicon late policy update.

  The meaning of Policy is defined by silicon code.
  It could be the raw data, a handle, a Protocol, etc.

  The input Policy must be returned by SiliconPolicyDoneLate().

  In FSP or non-FSP path, the board may use additional way to get
  the silicon policy data field based upon the input Policy.

  @param[in, out] Policy       Pointer to policy.

  @return the updated policy.
